A React-based Pokémon list application to view and interact with a list of Pokémon. It fetches Pokémon data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon) and supports horizontal infinite scrolling, displaying basic Pokémon details on onClick, and providing dynamic loading as the user reaches the end of the list.
